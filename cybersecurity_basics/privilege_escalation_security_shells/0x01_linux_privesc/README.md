0. Flag File Privilege Escalation

The goal of this challenge is to gain elevated privileges on the linux machine.

Make sure to enumerate properly the running processes, scheduled tasks, services, permissions and user management in order to find a weakness that can be exploited to gain root permission on the machine.

The flag is under: /root/flag.txt

Hint:

Focus on user permissions and available sudo commands.

Leverage the choomcommand with sudo privileges to escalate permissions and gain access to restricted files.

1. Privilege Escalation through Cron Job Misconfiguration
The goal of this challenge is to gain elevated privileges on the linux machine. Make sure to enumerate properly the running processes, scheduled tasks, services, permissions and user management in order to find a weakness that can be exploited to gain root permission on the machine.

Environment:

Target File:/root/flag.txt

Vulnerable Area: Misconfigured cron jobs or writable scripts executed by cron with root privileges.

Permissions: The script is writable by your user.

Once root privileges are obtained, access the flag file and read its contents.

2. SUID Binaries and Privilege Escalation Challenge

You are a security analyst tasked with auditing a Linux system for potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities. During your assessment, you discover several SUID binaries that might be misconfigured.

Your mission is to identify these binaries and exploit any vulnerabilities to gain root access.

Objectives:

Identify SUID Binaries.

Analyze Binary Behavior.

Exploit Vulnerabilities.

Access the Flag.

Target Environment:

Target File:/root/flag.txt

SUID Binaries: Look for common binaries or any custom binaries present on the system.

target machine for this task:

cyber shell 0x02 linux privesc task3

*Hint: Why SUID Binaries Are Interesting: *

High Privileges: SUID binaries run with elevated privileges, making them prime targets.

Common Vulnerabilities: Misconfigurations, unchecked inputs, or buffer overflows in SUID binaries can lead to privilege escalation.
